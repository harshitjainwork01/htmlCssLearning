<!DOCTYPE html> specifies the document type and version.
<html> is the root element that encloses all the content on the webpage.
<head> contains meta-information about the webpage, such as the title that appears in the browser tab.
<title> sets the title of the webpage as it appears in the browser.
<body> contains the visible content of the webpage.
<h1> is a heading element that creates a top-level heading.
<p> is a paragraph element for text.
<ul> is an unordered list, and <li> elements represent list items within the list.
You can save this code in a text editor with the ".html" extension (e.g., "index.html") and open it in a web browser to see the webpage you've created.
